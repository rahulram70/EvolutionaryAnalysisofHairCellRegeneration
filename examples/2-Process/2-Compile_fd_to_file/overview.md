## Compile text files in a directory to a single file

This example was written initially as a tool for combining transcript lists into a single file. however, this has not been used in the project yet due to the changing needs of the analysis and datasets.

NOTE: This example may not be included in the final release of the project.

## Methods

|compile_dir_to_file.py |
|-----------------|
|here we provide a directory and output file path and then combine all text files in this directory and combine them to the file. |
|GOAL: this function should be re-written as a recursive (depth first search) function capable of combining all files up to a given depth in order to increase mobility of use. |
