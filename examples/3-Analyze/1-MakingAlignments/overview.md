## Using MUSCLE to align protein sequences

This is an example demonstrating how to achieve protein alignment using the MUSCLE (multiple sequence comparison by log-expectation) algorithm included in the biopython package.

## Methods

The core implementation is located in the procomp.py module and the high level use is demonstrated in the example experiment here.

## Results

Output is written as .fa (fasta) files to a output directory.
