## Comparing Gene, Transcript and Protein for Combination Count

this experiment aims to determine which method of orthologs provide the fewest number of combinations of alignments needed in the next step of the analysis.

## Methods

As demonstrated in the script to do this comparison we compute the number of combinations for each id given (either gene, transcript, protein) then get average and median combinations for each category and display them in results.

## Results

|Statistic |Gene |Transcript |Protein |
|----------|-----|-----------|--------|
|Average Combination |2.827e+60 |1.118e+60 |1.120e+60 |
|Median Combinations |8 |4 | 4|
