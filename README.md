# Procomp: A Protein Comparison Workflow
<hr>

### What is it?
    Procomp is a set of tools built in python 3 which can be used
    to analyze aligned seqeunces for user defined targets. The 
    project excels at problems with proteins across multiple species
    where contrast between two groups of the species is desired. 
    Procomp also draws on other tools already present for alignments,
    allowing for automation of multiple sequence alignments with 
    tools from biopython, as well as protein comparison within functional
    domain analysis.
